The woods were darker than Clara remembered, far denser than they had seemed on that cheerful summer hike three years ago. Now, in the dead of autumn, with the wind howling through skeletal branches, they felt sinister. She gripped the flashlight tighter, its weak beam barely slicing through the mist that clung to the air. Every snap of a twig underfoot sounded amplified, echoing in the stillness like a warning. The map she'd printed crumpled in her hand, damp from the cold sweat beading on her skin.

She shouldn’t have come alone.

But she had no choice. The letter had arrived without a return address, a single line written in spidery handwriting: "Come to the forest where we last met. You know why." She didn’t know who sent it or why, but the note had unlocked memories she thought she'd buried—the hike with her sister, the fight, and then...the disappearance.

Clara’s sister, Emma, had vanished that day, and no one had ever found a trace of her. The authorities had called it an accident, a fall perhaps, but Clara had never believed it. And now, after all this time, someone knew something. Whoever sent the letter had to know what happened.

The trees around her loomed taller, the path ahead narrowing into a barely visible trail. Clara stopped, her breath quickening. She scanned the surroundings, half expecting to see a figure in the distance, watching her. But there was nothing. Just the wind, the trees, and her heartbeat pounding in her ears.

A faint sound behind her.

She froze. The snap of a branch, this time deliberate. Someone was there. She whipped the flashlight around, its beam shaking in her trembling hand, but the mist swallowed the light. Her breathing turned ragged as she strained to listen.

"Who's there?" she called out, her voice echoing back mockingly. There was no response. Only the silence of the woods.

Clara turned and began walking faster, almost jogging now. The flashlight flickered—just for a moment—and then steadied. She let out a breath she hadn’t realized she was holding. The trail seemed endless, twisting deeper into the forest. She glanced down at her phone. No signal. She tried to reassure herself that this was just her mind playing tricks, that the forest wasn’t haunted by something waiting for her in the shadows.

Then, the flashlight flickered again—and died.

Panic surged through her. She fumbled with the batteries, cursing under her breath. The darkness closed in, suffocating. Her hands shook violently as she tried to twist the top off the flashlight. And then, in the blackness, she heard it again—this time closer.

Footsteps. Deliberate. Slow.

Clara’s heart slammed against her chest as she spun around blindly. “Stop!” she shouted, her voice breaking. The footsteps continued, closer, closer. She stumbled backward, tripping over a root. She fell hard, the damp earth cool against her skin.

And then, just as suddenly as they began, the footsteps stopped.

Breathing heavily, Clara lay still, listening.

A whisper, so soft she almost didn’t hear it: “You should have come sooner.”
